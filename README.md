# My Data Analyst Portfolio

Hey welcome ðŸ‘‹

This repo collects the projects, experiments and tools Iâ€™ve been learning with â€” everything from messy raw data to dashboards and automation. If youâ€™re curious about how I learn, what I build, or want to collaborate, youâ€™re in the right place.

Whatâ€™s in this repo
1. Marketing Analytics â€” End-to-End Project

A full end-to-end project built around a marketing problem.
Think: define the business question â†’ clean the data â†’ run sentiment analysis â†’ build a Power BI dashboard â†’ prepare a stakeholder-ready presentation.
(Thereâ€™s the raw file , a short write-up and the Power BI files in the folder.)

2. SQL Project

Exploratory Data Analysis for a multi-location retail supermarket using SQL (and some AI-assistance ). Great for practicing joins, window functions and aggregation patterns.

3. Power BI Project

An interactive dashboard focused on retail plant-store metrics â€” sales trends, store comparisons, and a few slicers that make exploration easy.

4. Excel Project

A Coffee Sales dashboard built in Excel â€” demonstrates pivot tables, charts, and a few hands-on tricks I used to clean and summarize the raw data.

5. n8n Automation Projects

Reusable workflow templates:

Gmail AI Agent â€” small automation to help with email triage/replies

RAG-based Chatbot â€” retrieval-augmented workflow for answering questions from docs

6. Course Certificates

Certs of the courses I completed that helped build these projects â€” listed so you can see the learnings that I used.

# Tech I use

SQL Â· Python  Â· Power BI Â· Excel Â· n8n Â· basic AI tools for prototyping

# Why I built this

Iâ€™m learning by doing â€” and sharing that process. Each project started because I wanted to solve a small, real problem and learn a specific skill (dashboarding, SQL patterns, automation, etc.). The repo is both a playground and a portfolio.

# How to explore

Start with the README inside each project folder â€” I keep notes on data sources and how I approached the problem.

Power BI files and Excel workbooks are in their folders.
